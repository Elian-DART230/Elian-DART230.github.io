    <h1>Life and its whims</h1>
    <p><strong>Time?</strong>perhaps it is only an illusion that is spoken of</p>
    <p>Time that takes life and with it our loved ones</p>
    <P>It is so absurd that I swim in the abyss of meaninglessness</P>
    <P>Where <b><em>nihilism</em></b> is my father</P>
    <p>Father that only shows me the truth</p>
    <p>The truth that is nothing more than a cruel vision of reality</p>
    <p>Life is nothing more than a river that I am angry about, of its inserted and unjust whims</p>
    <p>Poverty, death and greed, things that I can only complain about because they are all over the world</p>
    <p>Things that a simple optimistic thought would be seen as something mediocre.</p>
    <p>But, there is only mediocre left when those who have power,<br><br> only look out for themselves and for themselves.</p>
    <p>Happy knowing that those with power,<br><br> are also victims of what we all see wrong in society and with that, I submerge myself in a river without causes known as life.</p>
